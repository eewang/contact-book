Questions

* Golang
- What does the `form:"Name"` specification after the [field name] [field type] syntax for a struct mean?

* React
- What is the difference between `componentWillMount()` and `componentDidMount()`? How can I define two implementation of the same `componentDidMount` method in the parent and child components?
